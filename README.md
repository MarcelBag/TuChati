# 🌍 TuChati — Connecting Africa, One Message at a Time

**TuChati** is a modern, secure, and lightweight communication platform built under the **Tuunganes** initiative — designed to bring affordable, accessible, and private digital communication to African communities.

Our vision is to **empower individuals, organizations, and communities across Africa** with a unified platform for **messaging, voice, and video communication** — optimized for regions with **low or unstable internet connections**.

- **Backend:** Django + Daphne (ASGI) + Redis + WebSockets

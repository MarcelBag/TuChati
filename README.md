# 🌍 TuChati — Connecting Africa, One Message at a Time

**TuChati** is a modern, secure, and lightweight communication platform built under the **Tuunganes** initiative — designed to bring affordable, accessible, and private digital communication to African communities.

Our vision is to **empower individuals, organizations, and communities across Africa** with a unified platform for **messaging, voice, and video communication** — optimized for regions with **low or unstable internet connections**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

TuChati is a full-stack communication platform developed using:

- **Backend:** Django + Daphne (ASGI) + Redis + WebSockets  
- **Frontend:** React (Web)  
- **Mobile:** React Native (Android & iOS – planned)  
- **Deployment:** Nginx + Docker + VPS (Hostinger / tuunganes.com)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Security:** JWT Authentication + HTTPS + Role-based Access Control  

TuChati provides a **real-time chat experience** (private and group messaging) with **low bandwidth usage**, **local data caching**, and **end-to-end encryption (planned)** — ensuring messages and calls remain secure and accessible even in remote areas.
